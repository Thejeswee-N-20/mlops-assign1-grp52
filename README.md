# MLOps Assignment 1 – Group 52
## End-to-End Heart Disease Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end MLOps pipeline developed as part of the MLOps course assignment.


###Objective:
Design, develop, and deploy a scalable and reproducible machine learning solution utilising modern MLOps best practices. The assignment emphasises practical automation, experiment tracking, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, cloud deployment, and monitoring—mirroring real-world production
scenarios.
Dataset: Title: Heart Disease UCI Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
• CSV containing 14+ features (age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) and a binary target (presence/absence of heart disease).


### Problem Statement:
Build a machine learning classifier to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient health data, and deploy the solution as a cloud-ready, monitored API.


### Key Components
- Data acquisition and EDA
- Feature engineering and model training
- Experiment tracking using MLflow
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Model serving using FastAPI
- Containerization using Docker
- Kubernetes deployment
- Monitoring and logging
